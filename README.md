# The Design

The design is atempted to be user-centered by making it looks familier to other websites user has dealed with. It is simple and it has only two pages one for restaurans and the other for favorites. Also search, filters, and sort all at the top of the main page.. MoreOver, when user hover by the mouse over a restaurant they could see two buttons to add it to favorite or to view more details.

# Possible improvements and bugs & Other ideas and thoughts

1. the design could of course improve more and need multiple opinions

2. also maybe other features could be included when having better ideas about the project

3. I have some console bugs but without affecting the website which might be because of my browser plugins

4. maybe some functionlities could be written in a better way!

5. More work to make the website fit perfictly on every screen size (now it is working good in most of the cases)

6. Introducing multiple shallow and unit tests.
